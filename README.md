## Description
Tombola is a fun and exciting adaptation of the online marketplace. A combination of instagram, ebay and the classic raffle.  Sellers are able to raffle consumer items to the community. Buyers from the community then have a chance to win items by purchasing a percentage of these tickets. The application has been developed using react with a node.js backend and has been deployed to heroku.
